# lyriclensR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of lyriclensR is to test how to work with song lyrics. This is a very experimental package. Most things should not work. Use at your own risk.  

## Installation

You can install the development version of lyriclensR with:  

``` r
pak::pak("gorkang/lyriclensR")
```

For the Python dependencies:  

``` r
reticulate::py_install("lyricsgenius", method = "virtualenv")
reticulate::py_install("undetected_chromedriver", method = "virtualenv")
reticulate::py_install("setuptools", method = "virtualenv") # setuptools includes distutils
``` 

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to download all the lyrics for specific artists using the Genius API (maximum of 5000 calls for each account per day. For more information https://developer.subscriptiongenius.com/2/intro/):


```r
download_all_artists("Ye Vagabonds")
```

Here we download and process the lyrics for the songs of a Spotify list:

```r
library(lyriclensR)

MyList = get_and_process(WEB = "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3hdkI3sIYMAPTz2aXNgXt4")
download_all_songs(MyList)

```

Search for a word in the lyrics

```{r search}
# We include a small lyrics file with the package (100 songs)
filename = system.file("extdata", package = "lyriclensR") |> list.files(full.names = TRUE)

OUTPUT = lyriclensR::search_words(data = filename, 
                         highlight_words = "love")

# Here we show only 2 results
knitr::kable(OUTPUT$DF_table |> dplyr::slice_sample(n = 2))
```


Create a wordcloud using the lyrics of an artist: 

```r
library(lyriclensR)
create_wordcloud(lyrics = filename)
```
